# OGC Record reference

[OGC API — Records Part 1: Core 1.0](https://docs.ogc.org/is/20-004r1/20-004r1.html) defines discovery metadata and catalog access. A record describes a resource; the JSON encoding is a GeoJSON Feature. `OGCRecord` implements an in-memory adapter for that document shape, reusing PySTAC facilities. It does not implement service endpoints or search.

## Document structure

The adapter's schema reference is [recordGeoJSON.yaml](https://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/records/part1/1.0/openapi/schemas/recordGeoJSON.yaml).

| Member | Adapter behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | String or integer, excluding booleans. `record_id` preserves an input integer; PySTAC `id` is a string. Changing `id` to a different value changes the serialized identifier. |
| `type` | Serialized as `Feature`; `record.type` instead accesses the resource type under `properties`. |
| `geometry`, `bbox` | Copied on construction; geometry may be `None`. No geometric validation is performed. |
| `properties` | Metadata dictionary. Incoming `null` remains `null` when empty; adding metadata produces an object. |
| `links` | PySTAC links; `include_self_link=False` omits self links on serialization. |
| `time` | Optional top-level OGC temporal object, separate from STAC datetime properties. |
| `conformsTo` | `conforms_to` exposes a live list of conformance URIs, separate from STAC extension declarations. |
| `linkTemplates` | `link_templates` exposes a live list of template dictionaries. |
| Foreign members | Preserved in `extra_fields`; managed field collisions in constructor extras raise `ValueError`. Assets, collection ID, and STAC extension declarations are serialized when present. |

`to_dict()` and `to_record_dict()` return copied document metadata. New records do not automatically gain `stac_version`; a supplied foreign member is preserved. Merely creating or reading a record does not establish OGC conformance.

Reading absent `conforms_to` or `link_templates` creates an empty list in `extra_fields`. These getters reject a value of the wrong container/element type with `TypeError`. They do not validate URI syntax or template contents. `time=None` writes a JSON null; remove the `time` key from `extra_fields` to omit it entirely.

## Common metadata accessors

Both the record and `record.record_metadata` expose these live properties:

| Python name | JSON property | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `created`, `updated` | Same name | Timestamp string, with no automatic datetime conversion. |
| `type`, `title`, `description` | Same name | Resource classification and descriptive strings. |
| `keywords` | `keywords` | List of strings. |
| `themes` | `themes` | Theme dictionaries with `scheme` and `concepts`. |
| `language`, `languages` | Same name | Language dictionary, or list of dictionaries. |
| `resource_languages` | `resourceLanguages` | Resource language dictionaries. |
| `external_ids` | `externalIds` | External identifier dictionaries. |
| `formats` | `formats` | Format dictionaries. |
| `contacts` | `contacts` | Contact dictionaries. |
| `license`, `rights` | Same name | License and rights strings. |

Absent accessors return `None`; setting `None` deletes a property. Nested dictionaries remain open and are not schema-validated by the accessors. The existing nested typing helpers are static hints, not runtime validators or generated schema models.

## Compatibility and validation

`matches_object_type()` recognizes a Feature with an identifier, geometry key, and object-or-null properties. It is a structural check and also matches some STAC Items. Use `OGCRecord.from_dict()` explicitly.

`validate()` requires a supplied validator with `validate(document)`, configured for the OGC OpenAPI 3.0 schemas and references. The adapter delegates validation and propagates errors; it returns its schema URI after success. It does not supply a validator or verify service-level conformance. A generic JSON Schema validator must account for OpenAPI schema semantics, including `nullable`.

`to_stac_item()` requires an explicit STAC temporal extent and returns a separate Item. Links and assets are cloned. Validate that Item separately for STAC compliance. Some inherited PySTAC methods assume STAC temporal metadata; test the methods your application uses on timeless records.

See the [workflow/experiment guide](../how-to/ogc-records.md) for OSC usage and the [OGC Records overview](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/records/) for the wider standard.
